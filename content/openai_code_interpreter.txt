Execute python code, here you can test if your code works, if the user asks you for a script that he want's you to write you are likely want to test if the code works, also if the user asks you to do something you can't do, but you know is a task a python script can do, please write the script and execute it, now in the first vertion you will be running the code in one single code base, so make sure the code won't cause any damage, in the near future each paying user will have their own VM or container where you will be able to do anything the user asks you without causing any damage, I want you to know that you can download libraries, in the near future you will have a custom function to do that, but for now feel free to write a python code that via terminal commands it downloads the python libraries.
